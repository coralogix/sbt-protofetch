# **Reporting Security Issues**

The project's team and community take security issues.

We appreciate your efforts to disclose your findings responsibly and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities to [security@coralogix.com](mailto:security@coralogix.com). If the issue is confirmed, we will release a patch as soon as possible depending on complexity.
Alternatively you can go to the project's issues and create a new issue with "security" label applied to it.
